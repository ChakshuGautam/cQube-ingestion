# Defining Dimensions

cQube supports arbitrary dimension to be stored. There are only two categories of dimensions that are supported:

1. Time based dimensions
2. Dynamic dimensions

A dimension is essentially a data point that is not subjected to frequent upserts (updates & inserts) and remains mostly constant throughout.

For the **Attendance** example being considered, the following dimensions are viable dimensions

1. School
2. District
3. Time

## School as a dimension

The following example depicts a sample specification on how **School** as a dimension should be defined and configured in cQube.

Define the grammar for how the dimension data needs to be stored. Given that School and Districts are are very similar, they could be combined as well.For the school dimension it a sample data looks like the following - 

```json
{
    "data": {
        "school_id": 901,
        "name": "A green door",
        "type": "GSSS",
        "enrollement_count": 345,
        "district": "District",
        "block": "Block",
        "cluster": "Cluster",
        "village": "Village"
    }
}
```
The actual schema also includes the metadata that is required by cQube to store this dimension in the database. 

- The `indexes` field is used to create indexes on the database. This creates a simple BTree index for the list of columns shared.

- The `primary_id` field is used to create a primary key on the database.

The corresponding JSON Schema would need to be entered to accept the dimension as a valid input

```json

1. Once the dimension is defined, it can be added to cQube by using the dimension schema (definition grammar) API.

2. The next step is to insert data in the dimensions which can be done through a `POST` request to the dimension API. In this case it would be inserting the schools in the school dimension table.

## Time as a dimension

Example of a time dimension

```json
{
    "name": "Last 7 Days",
    "type": "time",
    "storage": {
        "retention": "30 days",
        "bucket_size": "7 days",
    }
}
```

Here the `retention` is the time for which the data will be stored in the database and the `bucket_size` is the time interval for which the data will be aggregated.

cQube has an upper limit to the amount of data that can stored based on the retention policy - 30M records. This is not enforced at the storage layer but the system is not optimized for datasets larger than this. This is kept to keep the architecture simple and not adding an additional layer of archival storage complexity. This is a soft limit for now and can be increased in the future.

If you have a requirement to increase this limit, please reach out to us.

The lowest `bucket_size` that cQube would support would be a day.

## Impact of Dimensions on Datasets

1. Impact on Datasets 
    - cQube Datasets are optimized for query based on dimensions.
2. Impact on Input Data 
    - The input data is validated against the dimension data before being persisted.
    - The event schema should always reference a dimension for this to work.
    

## Notes

1. All the APIs to enter the data are documented [here](https://github.com/Sunbird-cQube/spec-ms/blob/main/spec.yaml).

2. An update to the schema is not supported yet. To update please create a new schema and tie it up to the Dataset Model. Please note that this is a slower process and would lead to a downtime of the cQube instance until the migration is completed. Currently it can only happen through private APIs exposed to a developer.

3. A relational database is used to store the data in a flat manner. All fields are flattened and used as column names when creating a dimension table.

4. The schema provided to insert data is used to validate the data before inserting it into the database. This is to ensure that the data is in the correct format and the data types are correct. AJV is used to validate the data.
