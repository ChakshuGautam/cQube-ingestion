# Transformer Grammar

Transformers can be visualized as functions or transformations  : _`t(event) => dataset`_

Includes the following

- Event Schema it can act on
- Dataset Schema it outputs to
- Formula that allows 

A transformer is a [actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model). A sample actor can be something like this in Javascript. Ideally this could be the same for any another actor models in another framework as well. Currently we are using [xstate](https://xstate.js.org/docs/) for this.

```js
const transformer = {
  name: "transformer_name",
  event_schema: "es11",
  dataset_schema: "ds23",
  config: {
    spawn((callback, receive) => {
      // send to parent
      callback('SOME_EVENT');

      // receive from parent
      receive((event) => {
        // handle event
      });

      // disposal
      return () => {
        /* do cleanup here */
      };
    }),
  }
}
```
